# pocillopora_hDNA_uces

This repository holds the data and code for analysis of historical DNA (hDNA) sequenced from dried *Pocillopora* corals in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History dry collections. The manuscript detailing the results of these experiments is now published in *Coral Reefs*!

(A) IQ-TREE maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree depicting the placement of NMNH IZ Pocillopora specimens (in red) in the context of publicly available reference genomes (in blue), genomic species hypotheses (GSHs, in green), and contemporary specimens. The tree was constructed with a 50% sample occupancy matrix containing 1,510 UCE loci, 600,934 bp, and 37,584 informative sites, and nodes with <90% bootstrap support are labelled. 
(B) Photographs of NMNH IZ Pocillopora specimens that were successfully sequenced (>300 UCE sequences) and placed onto the ML phylogeny.
